        Hey, I'm Zoe and I'm the President of HullCSS! I'm in the final year of
        my Computer Science (with Industrial Placement) degree. My placement
        year was at Phillips 66, where I worked as an IT analyst. Academically,
        I have a lot of interest in AI and how it can be applied in real-world
        contexts such as healthcare. In my free time, I love baking and playing
        board games. If you have any questions about the society or just want to
        chat, feel free to reach out :)

        Heya, I'm Andrew, a fourth year Computer Science Software Engineering
        student and your Social Media Coordinator for this year :). I'll be
        managing all our social media sites, keeping you updated with all the
        socials we've got planned and everything Comp Sci adjacent. I'm a huge
        gamer and I'm involved with societies a little too much so if you see me
        around, chances are I'm lending a hand with another I'm on the committee
        for. Anyway, feel free to shoot me a message on Discord or any of our
        social channels if you've got a question or need help. I'm really
        excited for the year ahead and meeting you all!
